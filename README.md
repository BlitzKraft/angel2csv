# Intro

As I am applying for jobs in angel.co, I wanted to create a tracking list. It
seemed too inconvenient to do so by hand. So, I decided to automate it. 

## Usage

* Login to your account (angel.co), click on jobs in the top nav bar, and
  select one of the items in the left nav menu.
* Save the page as html. No assets are required, so just the plain html will
  do.
* Pass the name of the html file in `parse-json.py` 

And voila! You have a neatly formatted file to be imported into any spreadsheet
application.

Feel free to fork and star it!!
